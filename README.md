Beerace is a lightweight iOS prototype that simulates a live bee race. 
Using Swift and UIKit, it fetches the race duration from an API and starts a countdown. During the race, it polls the bee positions API to update the current order of racers in real time.
If a captcha challenge occurs, the app loads a web view so the user can verify and continue the race.
The project is built with MVVM, Combine, and SOLID principles to keep the code clean, testable, and scalable.

It was meant to be developed en 4 hours so this first commit is what i've reached so long. I will pick it up later to refactor, add other features and improve what was left raw.
